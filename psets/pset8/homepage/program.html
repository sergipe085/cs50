            <h1>My favorite hobby is Programming!</h1>
            <p>
                I started programming in 2013 with arduino and did several basic projects, like leds turning on and off etc. <br> Then, in 2018, I participated in <a style="text-decoration: none;" href="https://junior.robocup.org/rcj-rescue-line/" target="blank">Robocup Junior Rescue Line</a> Brazil and took second place in my state, which gave me a place in the national stage, where I took third place. In 2020, i started to program games with Game Maker Studio 2 and Unity. And now, in 2021, i started with web programming!

                </video>
                <p>This is a game I made to improve my knowledge of C++ in the unreal engine 4. In it you control a tank and its objective and eliminate enemies. You can also customize your tank, placing better pieces to win the battles more easily.

                  <source src="videos/towerDefense.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                </video>
                <p>This is a game I made for Game Jaaj 5 on Unity with C#. Your goal is to protect your tower by creating combat towers to stop enemies. Each combat tower has a different type (fire, ice, shock and cannon), you can merge these towers with a tower with attributes of 2 different types and you can also increase the level of the towers, increasing their damage, speed of attack and range.

                <p>This is a simple prototype made in about an hour of a mob game. I used Unity and C#.
